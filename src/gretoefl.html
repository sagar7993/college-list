                           <h5>WHAT IS GRE?</h5>

                           <p>Students planning to pursue Masters of Science, commonly known as MS, take the <b>GRE - Graduate Record Examination</b>.</p>

                           <p>Post July 2011, the GRE pattern has changed and the exam is no longer a computer adaptive test but the performance in the given section will determine the level of the next section.</p>

                           <p>New GRE has 2 sections for GRE Verbal and Quantitative. Each section is considered as one stage. First Section is Stage 1 (or called as Routing Stage). Depending on your performance, the test taker is routed to one of several alternative second-stage tests, each of which consists of a fixed set of questions and differs on average difficulty.

                           If you get high score in Section 1, your entire set of questions in Section 2 will be under Difficult (or very difficult) category. This makes the New GRE difficult to crack.</p>

                           <b>Examples:</b><br>
                           <ol>
                           <li>You get Quant section first. You solve all the questions which will be a mixture of easy, moderate and difficult. Assuming you did really well, your next section, say Verbal, will be more difficult. If you perform badly, your next section will again be easy.</li>

                           <li>Moderately difficult level of questions will be given to you in Section 1. Based on your performance, you will get one of Easy, Moderate and Difficult in section 2.</li></ol>

                           <p>Score 165 in Section 1 then you will be routed to Difficult Level in Section 2.
                           If you score 135 then you will be routed to Easy Stage 2.
                           Another variation can be</p>

                           <ul><li><b>Stage 1: Moderately Difficult</li>
                           <li>Stage 2: Very Easy, Easy, Moderate, Difficult and Very Difficult</li></b></ul>

                           <b>Myth:</b><br>
                           <p>
                           You should solve the first few questions (the first 8-9 questions) taking as much time as required and get them right. This is not true. It depends on the level of questions. You should not blindly follow this logic and lose too much time so that you do not have enough time in the end to solve the remaining questions which may turn out to be easier. It's “suicide”.</p>

                           <b>Must do:</b><br>
                           <p>
                           You SHOULD attempt all the questions even though you might have to mark an answer without spending enough time on it because an incomplete paper can cost you a loss of significant points.</p>

                           <b>How many types of GRE’s are there?</b><br>

                           GRE are of two types:
                           <ol>
                           <li><b>General Test: </b>The General Test takes into account verbal reasoning, quantitative ability, and analytical writing skills. Almost all the universities accept the General test score and usually everyone opts for this test. It takes place round the year and you can choose your date according to your convenience.</li>

                           <li><b>Subject Test: </b>The Subject Test measures the achievement in a particular subject area or extensive background in that discipline. These tests are in the following areas: Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Literature (English), Physics and Psychology. It is conducted on a fixed date for everyone, more on the terms of an entrance exam. Mostly none of the engineers go for this.</li>

                           <p><b>* </b>For the Issue task, two essay topics will be presented and you will choose one. In this type of essay, you usually agree and disagree with the author. There is no need to take a stand. You can state the pros and cons of the topic.<br>
                            <br>
                           <b>** </b>The Argument task does not present a choice of topics; instead, one topic will be presented. In this type of essay, you should disagree with the author. As the name suggests, you should argue with the author’s views.</p>

                           <p>After all the verbal and quant sections, a research section follows. This section is like essay writing on a topic presented to you. However, it is NOT evaluated towards the final score. Hence, a lot of people skip this section and proceed to the last part of checking their score.</p>

                           <p><b>Note: </b>The AWA section is always first, followed by two Verbal sections and two Quantitative sections, in any order. Basically, you will have two verbal sections and two quantitative sections and will contribute towards your final score. You will not be informed prior or during the exam about which section will be taken into account and hence you must give cent percent effort in all the sections.</p>

                       <h5>PREPARATION FOR GRE:</h5>
                       <p>Eventhough the exam pattern has changed, most part of the preparation remains the same. Since Antonyms and Analogy aren't a part of the new syllabus, learning/memorising the word is NO MORE important. Still, it is always advised to have strong vocabulary as sections like Sentence Completion demand you to be extremely quick with the words and its meaning/connotation.<p>

                       <b>Getting started..</b><br>
                       <p>It varies with each and every individual on how fast he/she finishes studying for GRE and is set to take it. But in general, you need around 50 days, give or take a few. As per the old pattern - it starts with learning words from what you call <b>'flash cards'</b> - the popular of the lot - which have around 4000 words. If you're pretty consistent with reading newspapers, you definitely have an edge, considering you’ve probably come across a handful of words already. In short, be quick with the meanings and its usage of the words.</p>

                       <b>A Month or so to the GRE..</b><br>

                       <p>Once you are done with a considerable number of words, start solving the <b>BigBook</b>. Get the book from one of your friends who have already taken the GRE. If you still don't get it, download it from the internet. It is advisable to solve the big book on the screen as you have to take the exam on the computer. It makes you familiar with it.<br>

                       It has got two papers in every test which follows the oldest pattern of GRE (38 questions in 30 mins for verbal; 30 questions in 30 mins for quant). Try solving the paper with the old pattern (rather than adding your own touch-ups and increasing time or other such weird experiments). This will definitely improve your speed. Overall, there are 27 tests (54 papers). Try solving atleast 20 papers before you get bored (can’t blame you for that). Give a week to the BigBook and solve minimum 2 papers a day. Of course, more wouldn’t hurt.<br>

                       Along with the BigBook, solve <b>BARRONS</b>. It's a simple book but teaches you a lot. Solve the quant section completely. It's fun to solve and is useful. It has 5 papers with the new pattern. Solve them gradually.</p>

                       <b>Another fortnight to go..</b><br>

                       <p>In the last 20-22 days, start taking the adaptive exams on the computer. There are hundreds of tests if you search on the internet and one can't solve all. Hence, there are some standard tests one needs to solve. Cambridge, Princeton, Kaplan (very important) and PowerPrep (GRE level) are those.<br>

                       Cambridge is an elementary test and it helps you get acquainted with the adaptive exams on the screen. You need a maximum of two days.<br>

                       Then comes Kaplan, the most important of all the above mentioned tests. It has 6 practice tests each for Verbal and Quant and 3 full length tests. Kaplan Quant is really important and helpful, so be serious with it. Make sure you evaluate all your tests properly. Taking a test is not a big deal; learning from it is definitely one.<br>

                       Solve Princeton simultaneously along with Kaplan. Finish it off in a week or 10 days.</p>

                       <b>Last week..</b><br>

                       <p>Study for your <b>AWA</b> (essay) 5-8 days prior to "the" day (though we suggest that reading and solving essays right from day one can help you get a very high score) Read some essays from Barron’s, the method to write it and take any topic from these tests and write it down. Exchange the essays amongst your friends so you'll get an idea how well they write.  Solve the PowerPrep tests completely along with the essays to get an idea of your patience level. Take our word, full test is quite long!<br>

                       While many students believe that AWA does not play a vital role in the admissions, here's a good read on "Why AWA Should Not Be Ignored?"</p>

                       <b>Oh! Almost forgot about Quant..</b><br>

                       <p>Quant at the first glance might seem simple but it isn’t so simple as to be neglected. Engineers can give less time for math as they’ll be familiar with many of the topics, but remember that the split score matters a lot, so a minimum of 750 (old pattern) or 160 (new pattern)is like a 'must' for engineers. The rest are advised to solve as many questions as they can. Solve some renowned professors notes, Kaplan book (not the adaptive computer exam) and any other notes as and when you get time during your preparation.<br>

                       It definitely varies with every student on how they got about Quant, but the one mentioned above is how it is generally followed.</p>

                           <h5>WHEN SHOULD I TAKE THE GRE?</h5>

                           <p>GRE takes place round the year. It is not like any other exam where the dates will be announced in the newspaper or any official website. So, anytime you feel you are in a position to go and take your best shot, GO FOR IT.</p>

                           <p>Generally, engineering students prefer to take GRE in their third year either in March or August. No superstitious connections but some logical reason behind it. GRE is an exam which requires you to be tension-free and relaxed. Most engineers remain free during these two months as they aren’t occupied with any work like exams, submissions, etc. There are a few advantages of choosing March over August as enumerated below :</p>
                           <ul>
                           <li>March is the ideal time to take GRE because you get one more chance to take the exam in August if suppose you don’t score well in the March attempt.</li>
                           <li>Giving GRE in March won’t clash your deadlines with final year project, placements (some companies do come in August-September) and most importantly you get more time for your Application Process for USA.</li>
                           <li>You can take TOEFL without any pressure, if your GRE is over in March.</li>
                           <li>If you're planning to appear for MBA entrance exams as well, you get sufficient time.</li>
                           You might have to bunk a lot of lectures for the GRE preparation. This can seriously affect recommendations from your teachers as attendance is the prime parameter. Giving the exam in August leaves you with very less time to ‘butter’ them and make things turn your way.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <br>
                           <b>Problems with choosing a date..</b><br>
                           
                           <p>Often, the slots are already full and you don’t get your desired date. So, book your date well in advance. Some prefer to wait till the last minute, and once they are confident about their preparation, they start searching for the nearest available date. This can be a problem as you might not get a single date and have to wait for a long time which in turn affects your preparation leading to a BAD day.</p>

                           <p><b>Note: </b>Please choose your date wisely and carefully. Although you're allowed to postpone the date, you will only be making the ETS richer by $50 or an additional $190 if you reschedule it within 3 days of the exam.</p>

                           <b>Should I choose end of the month as my GRE day as questions will be repeated?</b><br>

                           <p>It’s a big misconception amongst a lot of students.  Questions don’t repeat at all and even if they do, they repeat in the quant section with a maximum of only one or two questions, which anyway are extremely simple to solve or you must have already solved.</p>

                        <b>A. </b>The registration fee for taking GRE is USD 190 which includes reporting your GRE scores to 4 universities of your choice.</br></br>

                        <b>Q. </b>How do I register for the GRE?</br>

                        <b>A. </b>You can register online or by phone or by mail. The detailed information about registering for the GRE can be found at www.gre.org<br></br>

                        <b>Q. </b>How many times in a year is GRE exam held?</br>

                        <b>A. </b>GRE is offered on all working days in India. The schedule can be obtained from Prometric in person, through phone, e-mail or online.</br></br>

                        <b>Q. </b>How many times can I take GRE?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>GRE can be taken unlimited number of times with a gap of a minimum of 31 calendar days between 2 tests. (It is highly advisable not to appear for GRE too many times as it may affect the applicant’s candidature). However, one can give the test only 5 times in a calendar year.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>If I take GRE more than once, which score will be considered by the universities?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>The best score is taken into account by most of the universities. A few, though, consider the average.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>What is the validity of the GRE exam?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>Your GRE score will be valid for 5 years after from the date the test was taken.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>Does admission to universities depend only on GRE scores?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>It is one of the various criteria that the admission council looks at. However, a good GRE score does improve chances of admission and financial aid.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>How do I pass on my score to the colleges where I want to apply to?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>The universities only accept official scores sent directly by ETS. Scores to four colleges can be sent free of cost while taking the exam. Subsequently, for each score report sent to a college, you would have to pay USD 23.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>What is an ideal GRE score for engineering students?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>Anything above 1250 (old pattern) or 310 (new pattern) is considered good but you should always aim higher. An engineering student should score above 750 (old pattern) or 160 (new pattern) in quant as this counts a lot.<br><br>

                        <b>Q. </b>How important are extracurricular activities?<br>

                        <b>A. </b>Extracurriculars are always an add-on to your profile. Any achievements at the state or national and international level are considered important. Working for social causes such as for an NGO or charity trusts on a regular basis (Please don’t start visiting NGOs when your application dates are nearing, it won’t help) helps a lot. Participating in college festivals or becoming a head of some committee does not count much.<br>

                            <h5>WHAT IS TOEFL?</h5>

                            <p><b>TOEFL</b> is a test of English proficiency. It stands for <b>Test of English as a Foreign Language</b>. International students need to show a certain amount of comfort with English as the primary language of communication. TOEFL is conducted to check the student’s capability during Teaching Assistantship (TA). TOEFL ibt, generally preferred by all international students, is the new internet based test which has four sections, each which would constitute a certain form of student interaction with the education system.</p>

                            <p><b>Who Takes the TOEFL Test?</b>
                            More than 27 million people from all over the world have taken the TOEFL test to demonstrate their English-language proficiency. The average English skill level ranges between Intermediate and Advanced.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Students planning to study at a higher education institution</li>
                            <li>English-language learning program admissions and exit</li>
                            <li>Scholarship and certification candidates</li>
                            <li>English-language learners who want to track their progress</li>
                            <li>Students and workers applying for visas</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <b>When should I take TOEFL?</b><br>

                            <p>As the TOEFL score is valid for two years, choose your date wisely. Usually, students take TOEFL in the month of September, as it is the ideal time when a student applying for MS is done with his GRE and has no other academic commitments.</p>

                            <p><b>Where and When Can I Take the TOEFL iBT Test?</b>
                            The TOEFL test has more test dates (more than 50 per year) and locations than any other English-language test in the world. You can retake the test as many times as you wish, but you cannot take it more than once in a 12-day period. If you already have a test appointment, you cannot register for another test date that is within 12 days of your existing appointment.</p>

                            <p><b>Conditional admit: </b><br>
                            If you are applying to a university without your TOEFL score, it’s perfectly ok but it’s always better if you’re done with it. When you apply to a university without a TOEFL score, it gives you a conditional admit which means that you have take your TOEFL exam for the confirmation of the admission. If your TOEFL score is low, then the respective admission committee will either tell you to repeat the exam or take up a course in their institution and complete it. The course isn’t a part of your regular curriculum and it becomes hectic. Moreover, it’s very expensive. So repeating TOEFL is the right choice.</p>

                            <p>The TOEFL test measures your ability to use and understand the English language as it’s read, written, heard and spoken in the university classroom. As the most accepted English-language test in the world, more than 9,000 universities, agencies, and other institutions in more than 130 countries accept the TOEFL test as part of their admissions criteria — including nearly every college and university in Australia and the UK.</p>


                            <p><b>Note: </b>TOEFL is a <b>MUST</b> for International Students.</p>

                            <p><b>Note: </b>If you get Short format in Reading, then you will get Long format in Listening or the other way round.</p>

                            <p><b>Reading: </b>

                            This section is very similar to the RC section in GRE, with the only difference being that this one is VERY simple. There can be two formats in Reading: Short format or Long format. </p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>Short Format</b> consists of 3 passages each approximately 700 words in length and with 12-14 questions and overall time is 60 minutes. The passages are on academic topics.</li>

                            <li><b>Long Format</b> is 100 minutes duration and has 5 passages each approximately 700 words in length and with 12-14 questions. Of the 5 passages only 3 will be evaluated to get your score, the other 2 are experimental and do not matter at all. However, you have no idea which ones will matter and which ones won’t, so you have to give your best in all.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Listening: </b>

                            This is a new section for most of the students and it tests the student’s listening skills. In this section you have to listen to entire conversations (A conversation involves two speakers, a student and either a professor or a campus service provider) or lectures at one go (which can be very boring). Again there can be two formats: Short or Long</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>Short Format</b> consists of two conversations and four lectures each having 5-6 questions. Overall duration is 25-30 minutes.</i>

                            <li><b>Long Format</b> consists of three conversations and six lectures each having 5-6 questions, of which two conversations and four lectures only will contribute to your score. The remaining are redundant but again you are kept in the dark about this, so give your best in all. Overall duration is 100 minutes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>NOTE: </b>If you get Short format in Reading, you will get Long format in Listening or the other way round.</p>

                            <p><b>Speaking: </b>

                            Speaking sections tests the ability to communicate in English in an academic setting. It has six tasks. Tasks 1 & 2 will prompt you to speak on some familiar topic like a personal experience. You are given 10-15 seconds to think and another 30 seconds to speak on each of the questions. Tasks 3 & 4 require you to read a paragraph, followed by listening to a short conversation and then respond to a question about what you read and heard. In the next two questions you have to listen to an audio clip, remember the important points in it and then answer the questions based on it in 45-60 seconds. Overall duration of this section is 20 minutes.</p>

                            <p><b>Writing: </b>

                            Although this is quite a different section, it should be comfortable section for those who have already appeared for GRE. You are required to write two essays: Integrated Essay and Independent Essay.</p>

                            <ul><li><b>Integrated Essay: </b>You have to read on an academic topic for two minutes and listen to a speaker discuss the same topic for the next few minutes.

                        <h5>PREPARATION FOR TOEFL:</h5>

                        <p>If you ever want to test your patience level, try and give the TOEFL exam. It’s a bloody four hours long examination and often the time duration will increase due to technical errors. The longer the examination, the lesser is its preparation.</p>

                        <p>Preparing for Toefl isn’t as tedious as GRE. A week or 10 days is more than sufficient. There is no need to solve any books for TOEFL. Directly, start off with the computer tests like Barron’s, Kaplan and Cambridge.  Each of these tests will have individual section of reading, listening, speaking and writing. Solve each section independently and get a hang of all the questions. Notice the type of questions as it is important to get familiar with the type.</p>

                        <ol><li><b>Reading Section</b> is pretty simple as it asks you basic questions which can be solved in less than 15 seconds. The only exception in reading is the last question. This question is pretty complicated, time consuming and difficult. But it offers you 3-4 points as well unlike the other questions. <b>GET IT RIGHT!</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Listening</b> is altogether a new section. You haven’t been exposed to this section in any part of any exam. So preparation is also required. It isn’t a difficult section but all you need to do is CONCENTRATE. You need to understand the accent in which they speak. If you are a regular follower of Hollywood movies or Star World shows, the ball is in your court.  You will hear a series of conversations or lectures and you will be asked questions based on it.</br>

                        <b>Important: </b>Jot down points while listening to the conversation as you don’t get a second chance to hear the same.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Speaking</b> is one of the important sections and preparing for it will be fun. It’s the shortest section of TOEFL but requires enough preparation. On presenting the 6 tasks to you followed by the questions, WRITE DOWN SOME POINTS while reading or hearing the questions in this section. They expect you to repeat some of the IMPORTANT words. Solve all the questions from Barron’s. If time and mood permits, solve Kaplan and Cambridge.</br>

                        <b>Note</b>: Students generally score less or sometimes the least in this section. Make sure you do well here as the university often grants you <b>TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIP (TA) </b>based on your speaking exam.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Writing Section</b> doesn’t require you any preparation. You will be happy to reach this section as the horrible 3 hours will soon be over.  It’s the same part which you have been preparing since childhood days - <b>ESSAY</b>. Just see the type of the essays from Barron’s. If your writing and expressing skills are brilliant, you can excel in this section.</li></ol>
