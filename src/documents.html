                            <h3 class="sop">Statement of Purpose</h3>
                            <p>“Statement of Purpose” Does it sound heavy and important? Yes, it is. The university selecting you wants you to answer some questions. They want you to know why? Why are you choosing that particular university? Why do you prefer to do your masters in a particular course? And you need better answers than, “I am doing it for the money" or "Because my uncle did the same, and has now nicely settled in the US, I am merely following his footsteps."They want to know your plans, goals and ambitions. So it would not be completely wrong to say that your SOP would be one of the most important documents you would be submitting to the university. And it is one of the major factors deciding your ADMIT OR REJECT!<br>
                            <h6 class="lol">Tips for writing an SOP:</h6>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Knowing yourself is very important. The SOP will be stating your goals, interests, career plans and aspiration. Hence it is very important to ask yourself these questions about you first and then proceed.</li>
                            <li>You can start your first paragraph by a quote or by mentioning your childhood interests and stressing how it directed you to the engineer you are today. For example:  An automobile engineer could possibly write about his fascination with cars since he was a toddler.</li>
                            <li>Your next two paragraphs could state your undergrad percentage; you could highlight your marks in a particular subject as an indication of your interest to pursue it as a specialization in Masters. Explain your publications, internships and certification if any. You can talk about what you learned from your final year project.</li>
                            <li>4. This is the most IMPORTANT paragraph. The fourth paragraph should indicate why you have preferred that university and your liking for the particular course you are pursuing.</li>
                            <li>5. The concluding fifth and sixth paragraphs should describe your long term and short term goals, possibly indicate how pursuing MS will help you achieve it. You should also state how qualifying as Master of Science will help you bring a lot of value to the institution and to your home country.</li></ol>
                            <h6>What not to write in a SOP?</h6>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Avoid copy-pasting. We always copied our essays from Wren and Martins or some local publications. But this essay is about YOU, your goals, your plans and your interest. And these features in you do not have a match with anyone else on this planet. So make your statement of purpose as unique as yourselves.</li>
                            <li>Do not boast. Talk about your achievements in a subtle way. 
                            For example: 
                            DO NOT say I have always been very intelligent and smart compared to my peers. I won a C coding competition in standard 8, when most of the people in my class dint know what coding was.
                            DO say: I have always had interest in coding, which made me practice more coding than my peers. I won a C coding competition in standard 8, it was this interest in me that finally lead me to choose Computer Engineering as my undergrad engineering option.</li>
                            <li>Avoid using slangs or SMS language.
                            DO NOT say: I want to choose ur university because of the gr8 infra provided to students of aerospace engineering.
                            DO say:  I want to choose your university because of the great infrastructure provided to students of Aerospace Engineering.</li>
                            <li>Do not talk about your interest in dollars. Do not share your ideas with anyone; copied SOP's can be identified.  Do not make it too long or boring in any one specific topic.</li></ol>
                            <h6>Process of writing an SOP:</h6>
                                <ol>
                            <li>Based on the information above, start jotting down the points that come to your mind.</li>
                            <li>Try to spread them over 2-3 pages or even more.</li>
                            <li>Rate each sentence, based on how it describes you, its effectiveness. Try to make sure you do not include a lot of clichéd sentences. Remove all the banal points.</li>
                            <li>Once the cropping is done and you know which part of the essay you are going to keep in your final version, pay attention to the grammar and language. Try to ensure there aren’t any grammatical mistakes.</li>
                            <li>Total time required would be 20-30 days.</li>
                            </ol></p>

                            <h3>Letter of Recommendation</h3>
                            <p>LOR or a Letter of Recommendation, is a document that allows the admission committee of the universities you are applying to, understand the kind of student you were during your undergrad. It gives a chance to your employers and professors to express their opinion regarding you and explain why you deserve to get an admit from the particular university.
                            Hence, make sure those who write your LOR are your well wishers, because you want the LOR to make things better for you, not worse.
                            The person writing the LOR is expected to judge you on your academic performance, position in the class, compare how you stand out with respect to other students applying for the same course, your understanding of the subjects, whether you are effectively able to apply concepts in real time, your response in the lectures ,teaching potential, maturity etc.
                            They are also required to state how strongly they recommend you (For example: very strongly, strongly, moderate, with financial aid, etc.)
                            Your LOR should not be unrealistic and portray you to be the best student in your country; rather it should paint a desirable and realistic portrait of yourself.</p>
                            <h6>Who can give you an LOR?</h6>
                            <p>The LOR can be given to you by any individual with whom you have had a formal relationship, like your professors for instance or the Head of the company where you did your internship or worked full-time, your final year project guide, or any other teacher under whom you have completed projects, etc.
                            And no, although your friends, relatives, parents surely hold you in high esteem, they cannot write you an LOR, like we mentioned, you need to have a FORMAL relationship with the said person.
                            Note: The better the profile of the recommender, the more weightage will be given to your LOR, try to get a letter from a Principal, HOD, senior faculty, faculty qualified as PhD, etc.</p>
                            <h6>What all should be included in an LOR?</h6>
                            <p><b>First paragraph</b> should include the qualifications of the recommender and the number of years for which the recommender knows you.<br>
                            <b>Second paragraph</b> mentions your credibility with the projects done under the recommender’s guidance. It also includes your rank in the class.<br>
                            <b>Third paragraph</b> will vary from recommender to recommender. If you're taking one from the project guide, it should talk about your role in it, the description of the project and how you were as asset to the team etc. If you're taking one from the employer, it should talk about how well you did in your work/ internship, your role in the undertaken project, qualities, importance to the company.<br>
                            <b>Fourth paragraph</b> should include your excellence in extra-curricular activities and social services<br>
                            <b>Last Paragraph</b> should be concise (say 2-3 lines) and it should conclude the above points and tell the university to grant you admission along with Financial aid.<br>
                            <b>Bottom Left of Your Draft:</b> Recommender’s name, Signature & stamp, Qualification and his/her post in the current institution/company.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="tab-pane fade in" id="tab3">
                            <h3>Transcript</h3>
                            <p>A <b style="font-color:white;">Transcript</b> is an official document which comprises all your marks in detail (Semester-wise, subject-wise breakups, term work and viva marks) in a single sheet and is issued by your college. You have to make frequent visits to your college office for getting the sample transcript, entering the complete details of all the subjects starting from semester 1 till the current semester, approving it, getting it stamped and then sealing it.</p>

                            <p>Work can begin as soon as semester 6 results (for fresh applicants) are declared around September.
                            <br>
                            Number of copies required are around <b>15</b>.</p>

                            <h3>Bank Statement</h3>
                            <p>Frankly speaking, arranging a <b>Bank Statement</b> isn’t very difficult. Firstly, you need to know how much are you willing to, or in other words, how much can you spend for the next two years in USA (roughly around USD 55,000). Talk to your bank manager and get attested copies of the bank statement which is a proof of your financial solvency.<p>

                            <p>So, once your finances are in place and you've had multiple meetings with your bank manager and decided the amount with or without loan, final papers should be ready by November first week but it is advisable that you start approaching the bank early in October.<p>

                            <p>Number of copies required are generally <b>15</b>.<p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Affidavit</h3>
                            An <b>Affidavit</b> is similar to the bank statement, just that it is an official document issued by the Government and it states who will be financing your education. You can make an affidavit by simply going to the court and telling the lawyer the exact details to fill in.</p>

                            <p>Preparring this document doesn't take more than a day once you know who is ready to sponsor you and the exact amount. Tentative time is around November first week.</p>

                            <p>Number of copies required are generally <b>15</b>.</p>

                            <p><b>Important: </b>Make sure that the bank statement and affidavit amounts are the same.</p>

                            <h3>Resume</h3>
                            <p>A <b>Resume</b> is a document highlighting your achievements. It usually consists of your academic achievements, GRE and TOEFL scores, Co-curricular and extracurricular activities, explanation of your academic projects and personal details.
                            
                            <p>It is extremely important to have a strong resume.

                            <p>A good time to engage in making a Resume would be mid October.</p>
