                            <p>The humble master’s degree has experienced a surge in popularity over the last decade. Every year a significant proportion of undergraduates decide to swap those BA or BSc letters after their name for an MA or MSc. So what’s the draw? What exactly is a master’s degree and is it worth it?</p>
                            <p>
                            As a general rule, you’ll need to have an undergraduate bachelor’s degree in the bag before you can do a master’s degree. Broadly speaking, there are two types of master’s degrees: taught master’s and research master’s. A master of research isn’t about lording it up in the library; it’s still a taught course, but 60% has to focus on an individual research project. Most of the time you’ll only be able to do an MA, MSc or MRes related to your first degree; although there are exceptions to the rule.</p>
                            <p>
                            A master’s usually lasts one or two years, except for integrated master’s degrees which take place over four or five years. The reason, is that an integrated master’s is essentially an undergraduate degree with the add-on of a final master’s year. It’s like ordering a meal deal at McDonald’s rather than paying for your fries and drinks separately, except your university education doesn’t come dipped in fat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            You gotta assess whether a master’s is worth it, maybe by talking to people who are already in your chosen industry. Do you know many people in the industry with a master’s degree? What kind of roles are they in? Do they feel their master’s helped get them where they are? A master’s degree with strong industry connections, where other students went on to exciting jobs with good employers, might just be worth the investment. You should also choose a master’s that is as specific as possible to your career aims.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            A master’s costs a lot (usually the price of a new, nippy, no-frills hatchback car), and you’ll also have to support yourself whilst you study. Therefore, you should be fairly confident that the money you invest in your master’s degree will be returned to you (with interest) later on. Indeed, you should get more out of your master’s than you put in. The key thing to emphasise is that a master’s isn’t a one way ticket to a graduate job. You will need to prove the value of your master’s degree to prospective employers and the edge it gives you over other candidates.
                            </p>

                            There are different prestigious schools in America. This is the very reason why most students want to study in this country whether they are taking their college degree or pursing their masters or PHD. Studying in America is not all about a bed of roses most especially if you are a foreigner. There are many adjustments that you need to be ready most especially with the emotional aspect.

                            <p>
                            To pursue a Masters programme, 12 + 4 years of basic education is required. There are two major intakes for most universities, these being in September (autumn) and in January (spring). The application deadlines for the autumn intakes start from January, and the programmes in spring start from October the year before. Most American universities require candidates to take the GMAT / GRE tests before starting the Mastersdegree.

                        <p>Unlike at undergraduate level, the application process for master’s degrees isn’t completely centralised. You’ll need to apply directly to individual institutions. Be warned that application deadlines vary from university to university. It’s also a good idea to apply as early as possible. Usually the application process will involve completing an online application form and providing academic references. Entry requirements for master’s degrees vary; for most you’ll need a BA or a BSc, but relevant work experience might be considered in lieu for certain courses. Academic requirements will also differ from institution to institution.</p>

                        <p>Once you’re done with your GRE and TOEFL, and hopefully obtained a satisfactory score, you will start feeling relaxed thinking, “Well, now my job’s done”. It won’t be long enough when you’ll realise that appearing for GRE was just the beginning. The major chunk of the work still remains and frustration slowly creeps in because you keep forgetting one thing or the other. The ideal time to be done with your GRE and TOEFL exams is August-September. Listed below are the important steps that you need to follow after your GRE and TOEFL:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Deciding your Course and University: </b><br>
                        This is probably the most important and the most hectic time you will go through. You should choose a course purely based on your interest. Usually, students opt for a course based on their undergrad stream, although you can apply to any other different course. The only important part is that you should be able to justify to yourself why you want a course different from your undergrad stream. Work should begin on deciding a course and a university around September third week, earlier the better.</li><br>

                        <li><b>Organizing all the necessary Documents: </b><br>
                            This is, as usual, tedious and boring. You have to run here and there, from the office on the first floor to the HOD on the 4th floor, each will keep dumping the work on the other.  It isn’t so easy to obtain transcripts, LOR’s, attested mark sheets and Bank Statements. As said before, earlier you engage in this work lesser will be the problems. The documents required are - Letters of Recommendations, Transcripts, Bank Statement, Affidavit, Statement Of Purpose, and Resume. A detaled description of these documents is given <a href="documents.html">here</a>.</li><br>

                            <p>Many students slog for entrance exams, crack them, go through the GD-PI drills, and finally even manage to get into a good B-School, without having any clue whatsoever about what to expect from the next two years of their lives. Of course, they know what they’ll get two years hence – a nice little job from a massive conglomerate, and a big fat paycheck. Mind you, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that mentality; it’s perfectly normal and perfectly understandable. But it certainly wouldn’t hurt to get a sneak peek into a two-year journey that you intend to embark upon soon, right?</p>
                            
                            <p>The core courses in the MBA program are designed to introduce students to the various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, operations management, etc. Students in MBA programs have the option of taking general business courses throughout the program or can select an area of concentration, though many institutes (especially in India) offer their own specialized courses, which means that the institute itself chooses the specializations for students.</p>

                            <p>Over the two years of MBA, you’ll study about various factors (laws, trends, markets, economies) that effect businesses and the running of businesses. You’ll also be exposed to ‘real-life situations’ in an attempt to make sure that you don’t crumble under pressure if the going ever gets tough in the future. There are a number of subjects which, more than anything, simply broaden your perspective about everything under the sun.</p>

                            <p>One must not forget that an MBA (especially in India) is a pretty rigorous program. Kiss goodbye to 10 hours of sleep, and say hello to all-nighters where you have to slog in order to meet deadlines. Ask your friends to bear with (or without) you for two years, since you’re hardly going to have enough time to breathe, never mind socialize.</p>

                            <p>Don’t get discouraged, though. Some of your best times will be in your B-School, specially if it is one of the higher-ranked ones where the programs are residential. Studying at good MBA institutes actually becomes a pleasure, something to remember. Meeting deadlines and completing projects becomes enjoyable. Most importantly, you make some excellent friends, and develop as an individual on the whole.</p>

                            <p>MBA is among the most pursued post graduation options in India. Partly responsible for this is the fact that the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs A, B, C, L, I, K)along with other institutes like S.P.Jain, MDI, JBIMS, XLRI etc. have set extremely high standards for management education in India. As a result of this, Multi National Corporations (MNCs) operating in India has never had the need to look for talent elsewhere. They have been the regular visitors to the campuses of the top B-schools, and have offered managerial designations coupled with sky rocketing pay packages to the graduates of these B-Schools. The average salary offered at the top 10 B-schools last year for Indian postings was Rs. 6-7.5 lacs per annum.</p>

                            <p><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF IDEAL B-SCHOOL CANDIDATES: </b></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>People with a Plan: </b><br>
                            Business school isn’t for the clueless; it isn’t meant to be a two-year placeholder in your middle or late 20s. Business schools look for people with a career plan that includes a legitimate need for an MBA—so even though it’s okay to go to B-school without being sure what you want to do with your life, you should think about possible career goals, and whether attainment of them would be made easier with an MBA, before applying.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Leaders and would-Be Leaders: </b><br>
                            The MBA is not essential for a leadership role in business—plenty of top executives got where they are by moving up through the ranks—but business school can be a great weigh station on the road to a leadership-oriented career.
                            <br>
                            By the time you graduate, you’d have spent thousands of hours in class or on group projects reading about, thinking about, and talking about a wide variety of businesses. As a result, you’ll be better equipped than ever to make high-level business decisions.
                            <br>
                            And you’ll probably spend some time studying “softer,” people-focused coursework and projects, which will give you tools that will help you manage people in the pursuit of business goals.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Career Changers: </b><br>
                            In business school, you’ll get a chance to think through a wide range of business problems in a wide range of industries. You’ll gain the skills needed to perform a variety of specific job functions. Having an MBA can make you attractive to a range of employers no matter what industry you worked in before B-school.</li><br>
